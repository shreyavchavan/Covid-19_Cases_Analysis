# Covid-19_Cases_Analysis
COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has affected millions of people worldwide. This project aims to analyze COVID-19 case data in India, including active, positive, cured, and death cases across different states. The primary goal is to gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus using data analysis techniques and visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
The project utilized Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, Seaborn for statistical visualizations, and Matplotlib for creating detailed plots and charts. These technologies enabled efficient data handling and analysis, helping to identify state-level trends in COVID-19 cases.

Flow of the Code:
•	Load the dataset and clean the data.
•	Perform exploratory data analysis, including calculating total cases.
•	Generate summary statistics and check for missing values.
•	Visualize the data using pair plots, bar plots, and pie charts.
•	Analyze trends by state for active, positive, cured, and death cases.
•	Drop unnecessary columns and generate stacked bar charts for better insights.

Real-Time Applications:
	Monitoring COVID-19 case trends in different regions.
	Helping government and health agencies allocate resources efficiently.
	Providing visual insights for public awareness and policy-making.
	Tracking state-level recovery and death rates to improve healthcare responses.
